The repository contains two kinds of content:

1. **stock**: kernel, package and guide of development for WD MyCloud Gen2 stock system. I packed `kernel`, `entware`, `Aria2`, `ffmpeg`, `rclone` and `busybox`. All other things are from Auska's repository. I've completely delete the stock system. Thus, no new things will be added.

2. **debian**: kernel, package and guide for debian jessie packed by [Fox](https://community.wd.com/t/clean-os-debian-openmediavault-and-other-firmwares/93714). I built or wrote most scripts here from scratch. Although I may add something in future, it's not very likely since I'm pretty satisfied with the current status, unless another meltdown bug is found in linux's community.
